What is the community?

The community is a project which is aim at creating a town, it is made up of different departments, the different departments are in charge of various tasks assigned to them and they are set with the following objectives;
1.	Getting every product and services a low cost
2.	Enjoying best quality of everything
3.	Enjoy products from skilled and professional workers of The Community

3.	ICT department
4.	Banking department
5.	Agriculture department
6.	Medical department
7.	Cosmetic department
8.	Building and Transport department
9.	Fashion and design department

How does the community work exactly?

Each department raises money for the community through the activity of selling their product or also exporting them to various countries, the money generated from the various departments is sent to the account of the members of the community which is 50% and the rest are for the various departments.

Each member in the community is required to pay a monthly fee of 10k which is sent directly to the banking department, if at the end of the month the requirements are not met, a fine of 2k will have to be paid. Each time there is a seminar, 3k is to be paid for the organization of the seminar.

NB: The community has rules and regulations which must be respected. It also assists those who leave far for their transport.

What about the community website?

Concerning the community's website, it will be created using a framework called Django, the web project will have an estimated duration of 1 and a half months. 

How will the website be structured?

The website will be created respecting the constraints of each department, each department will have his or her own privacy. For example, the Brewery department will not be able to see what is happening in the banking department, different pages will be created for each department, each department will be closed with a username and a password only the head of the department will have and its members that means to get to the cookery department, you’ll need a password and username to get in it. 

The community website will have a homepage or blog which describes how it works and it will be the public face of the community.

A payment gateway will be introduced so as any revenue generated will be deposited directly to the bank or MoMo account of the head of the banking department.

A chat will also be added in the community website for effective discussions to be carried out by each department on how things should move on.

That is all about the analysis of the community, if there is something to add, I’ll be informed. Each member must check the analysis before the creation of the website begins
